### Hello there! 

Thank you for checking out my Github. My Name is Benjamin Ung and I am a graduating CS major at Cal Poly Pomona. I currently looking for work in a software development role, but am open to other opportunities as well. I am currently working on the Northrop Collaboration Project (NGCP) UAV team designing and implementing software to detect lost hikers and identify wildfires. On the side, I am working collaboratively on  machine learning project to identify edible and poisonous mushrooms using a convolutional neural network model. 

In my free time, I enjoy playing ultimate frisbee and volleyball with my friends at my local park and recently I have been getting into Deep Rock Galactic (‚õèROCK AND STONE!‚õè). I also enjoy playing board games on a chill night out.

If you need to contact me, feel free to email: benjaminung6035@gmail.com.
