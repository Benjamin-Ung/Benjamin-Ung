### Hello there! 

Thank you for checking out my Linkedin! My Name is Benjamin Ung, and I am a computer science graduate at Cal Poly Pomona. I am interested in learning more in a software development role and am reading about object-oriented design patterns to further improve my understanding. I am also looking into learning about GitHub Actions and Kubernetes. 

The latest project I worked on was the Northrop Collaboration Project (NGCP) where I was a part of the UAV software team. The goal of the plane was to detect lost hikers and identify wildfires while flying autonomously. My responsibilities included testing and implementing long-range communications with the vehicle as well as integrating varying components using ROS2's publisher and subscriber system.

In my free time, I enjoy playing Ultimate Frisbee and volleyball with my friends, and recently, I've been getting into Deep Rock Galactic (‚õèROCK AND STONE!‚õè). I also enjoy playing board games on a chill night out. Please feel free to reach out to me!
